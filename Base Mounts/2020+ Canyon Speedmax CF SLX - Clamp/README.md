### Installation Notes

This version of the Bike Mount is clamp based which implies you do not need to remove the Speedmax extensions and can simply be bolted on. We recommend applying some tape to the mount area to improve grip and stability. Ne sure not to over tighten bolts (suggested torque, as for most carbon parts) is 5Nm.

NB: Be sure that the accessory bolts do not protrude through the base and come into contact of your bars.
