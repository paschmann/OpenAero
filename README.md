# OpenAero - A Open Source 3D-Printed Bicycle Accessory Mounting System

## Overview

Our goal is to develop a modular mounting system for bicycle accessories â€” ranging from water bottle holders and lights to phone and cycling computers. Partially inspired by Gridfinity, this system provides a base platform and is intended to be stackable. The motivation behind the definiton and open source nature of this project is to encourage community-driven design and innovation in the traithlon space.

### Concept

The concept is to create both specific and generic base mounts per bicycle model. Accessories can then be attached to the base mount using a standard pattern and design allowing you to mix and match your accesory "stack" depending on your needs. Accessories are not specific to a bike or model and are rather modular, and depend on your set of requirements.

### Design

Standardized rectangular base mounting system of 21mm x 47mm with two M6 bolt pattern 25mm apart in the center. 

### Printing

All bases and parts are intended to be 3D printed (many do require supports), some components require hardward to be installed after printing is complete and is fairly straight forward.

### Installation

In order to calculate the bolt lengths required, add up each accessories "Bolt Depth Required" on the accessories readme page.

Example:
You would like to mount a water bottle and computer mount on a Canyon Speedmax CF SLX.

Step 1. Select the Bike Mount required
Canyon Speedmax CF SLX Slide v1 - Bolt Depth Required: 12.5mm

Step 2. Select the bottle mount required
Bottle - Bolt Depth Required: 12.5mm

Step 3. Select the computer mount required
Computer Mount - Bolt Depth Required: 5mm

Step 4. Measure the height of your M6 bolt you purchased
Bolt - +- 5mm

Total Bolt length: 35mm

Extreamly important: ALWAYS assemble the base and accessories before installing them on your bike, to ensure no bolts or hardward will scratch or protude into your bike frame or mounting hardware.
